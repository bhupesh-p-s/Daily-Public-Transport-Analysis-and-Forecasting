#Daily Public Transport Analysis and Forecasting

This project leverages the **SARIMAX (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous regressors)** model for forecasting demand across multiple transit services, such as Local Routes, Light Rail, Rapid Routes, and other services. The goal is to provide insights into service demand trends and optimize resource allocation using time series forecasting.

## Insights from Service Data Analysis

### 1. **Interconnected Demand Across Services**
- Services like **Local Route**, **Light Rail**, and **Rapid Route** show strong correlations, indicating that changes in demand for one service often affect the others.
- **Actionable Insight**: Joint scheduling or resource optimization can be beneficial for these interconnected services to efficiently allocate resources during peak times.

### 2. **Seasonal Effects on Specific Services**
- **Rapid Routes** experience higher demand during peak seasons (e.g., summer), driven by tourism and seasonal commuters.
- **Actionable Insight**: Identifying which service types spike the most during each season can help optimize resource allocation for seasonal demand.

### 3. **Recovering from Disruptions**
- Demand dropped significantly in 2020 and 2022 due to external disruptions (e.g., COVID-19). However, services like **Rapid Routes** recovered faster.
- **Actionable Insight**: This shows the resilience of some services during disruptions, allowing for better planning for future disruptions.

### 4. **Unique Role of 'Other' Services**
- 'Other' services (e.g., shuttles) are less correlated with main services, suggesting distinct passenger needs or usage patterns.
- **Actionable Insight**: Separate strategies may be needed to improve their usage or better align them with the main services for increased efficiency.

### 5. **Inefficiencies in 'Other' Service Utilization**
- Weak correlations with core services suggest that **'Other' services** may be underutilized or inefficient.
- **Actionable Insight**: Investigating the reasons for low correlation can help optimize routes, schedules, and overall service utilization to improve effectiveness.

## Overview of SARIMAX Model

The **SARIMAX** model is a time series forecasting method that combines ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) with seasonal adjustments. It is particularly suited for datasets exhibiting seasonal trends and irregular patterns, making it ideal for forecasting demand in transit services with fluctuations.

### Model Components:
- **AR (AutoRegressive) Order (p)**: Number of lag observations for autoregression.
- **I (Integrated) Order (d)**: Degree of differencing for stationarity.
- **MA (Moving Average) Order (q)**: Number of lagged forecast errors used in the model.

### Seasonal Components:
- **SAR (Seasonal AR) Order (P)**: Seasonal AR parameter.
- **SD (Seasonal Differencing) Order (D)**: Seasonal differencing parameter.
- **SMA (Seasonal MA) Order (Q)**: Seasonal moving average parameter.
- **m**: Length of the seasonal cycle (e.g., 7 for weekly seasonality).

## Why SARIMAX for this Problem?

SARIMAX is a perfect fit for modeling service demand because:
- It accounts for **seasonal trends** (e.g., increased demand during summer).
- It handles both **non-seasonal** and **seasonal** components, capturing periodic rises and falls in demand.
- By including **exogenous variables** (e.g., external factors like weather), SARIMAX can make more accurate predictions, which are crucial for managing transit services.
